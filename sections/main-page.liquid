Cream chargers are small steel cartridges filled with nitrous oxide (N2O). Used with a whipped cream dispenser, they whip cream and create foams for food service. Each 8 g charger typically whips about 0.5 litre of liquid cream into roughly 1.5 litres of whipped cream. Chargers are for culinary use only.|||
Yes. You must be 18 or older to buy cream chargers in New Zealand. Retailers may verify age at checkout or on delivery. Selling or supplying nitrous oxide for inhalation or to minors is illegal. By purchasing, you confirm you are 18+ and will use chargers only for food preparation.|||
Chargers contain nitrous oxide (N2O), a colourless, non-flammable gas used in the food industry as a whipping propellant. The gas is food-grade and highly pure. Use only culinary N2O chargers and never inhale the gas.|||
Most standard 8 g cream chargers have a universal fitting and work with common 0.25 L, 0.5 L, and 1 L dispensers. Some systems that use larger N2O tanks require specific adapters. Always follow your dispenser's instructions.|||
Fill the dispenser with cold cream (and any sugar or flavouring) to the max line. Insert one charger into the holder and screw on to release the gas. Shake 5 to 10 times. Invert the dispenser fully and squeeze the trigger to dispense. Refrigerate any remaining cream in the dispenser.|||
Use one charger per 0.5 L dispenser and two chargers for a 1 L dispenser. Do not exceed the manufacturer's guidance. Over-charging can create unsafe pressure and damage seals. For better texture, keep cream very cold and shake adequately rather than adding extra gas.|||
Store in a cool, dry place away from heat and direct sun. Do not store above 50 degrees C. Chargers have a long shelf life, but seals can degrade over time. Use within about 5 to 7 years for best performance and check for rust or leaks before use.|||
An unused charger should be sealed and silent. A leaking charger may hiss or feel very cold. Do not use chargers that hiss or show rust, dents, or oil. If a correctly mounted charger releases no gas when pierced, replace it. Dispose of faulty chargers safely.|||
No. Cream chargers are pressurised gas cartridges and are prohibited on passenger aircraft in both carry-on and checked luggage. We ship within New Zealand by ground courier only. Do not attempt to fly with chargers.|||
Used chargers are made of steel and are recyclable. Ensure each charger is completely empty before recycling and place it in your household metal recycling bin or take it to a recycling centre. Do not discard full or unused chargers in general waste.|||
Keep chargers away from children. Never pierce a charger outside a dispenser. Do not heat or incinerate. Do not inhale the gas. Follow your dispenser's manual and treat chargers as you would any pressurised container.|||
Use very cold, high-fat cream. Shake the dispenser well after charging and dispense with the canister fully inverted. Check that the rubber seal is in good condition, that you have not overfilled past the max line, and that you used a full charger.|||
Whipped cream softens over time. For longer hold, keep it cold and consider a stabiliser. Avoid over-shaking, which can push the cream toward butter and cause separation. For room-temperature displays, use a stabiliser or heavier cream.

A cream dispenser is a sealed canister with a nozzle and trigger used to whip and serve cream. Fill it with liquid cream, charge it with a nitrous oxide (N2O) cream charger, and the gas dissolves into the cream under pressure. When you press the trigger, the mixture expands into whipped cream. Dispensers are used for whipped cream, foams, and mousses, providing quick, consistent results without hand whisking.|||
Most dispensers are aluminium or stainless steel. Aluminium models are lightweight and cost-effective for home use, typically with stainless steel tips. Stainless steel models are heavier duty and ideal for frequent or professional use, and they handle warm mixtures better. Both use food-grade materials; choose aluminium for lighter use and stainless steel for durability.|||
Common sizes are 0.25 L (250 mL), 0.5 L (500 mL), and 1 L (1000 mL). A 0.25 L dispenser holds about one cup of liquid cream. The 0.5 L size is popular for home use and typically yields about 1.5 L of whipped cream. The 1 L size suits commercial use. Always fill only to the marked capacity and use standard 8 g chargers. Most 1 L dispensers need two chargers.|||
Check the head gasket is seated and fit a nozzle tip. Pour cold cream, with any sugar or flavouring, up to the max line. Screw the head on firmly. Insert an 8 g N2O charger into the holder and screw it on until the gas releases. Shake 5 to 10 times. Invert the dispenser fully and squeeze the trigger to serve. Refrigerate any remaining cream in the dispenser.|||
Fully release any pressure first. Disassemble the charger holder, head, gasket, nozzle, and any removable valve parts. Wash the bottle with warm soapy water and rinse. Clean the head and small parts by hand with the cleaning brush. Avoid very hot water on rubber or silicone gaskets. Air dry completely before reassembly. Store dry, with no charger fitted.|||
Inspect the head O-ring regularly and replace if cracked or leaking. Keep the valve and nozzles clean and free of dried cream. Avoid cross-threading the head and bottle. Clean after each use and store dry with the head loose to prevent long-term gasket compression. A small amount of food-safe silicone grease on seals may be used if recommended by the manufacturer.|||
Yes. Replacement nozzle tips, gaskets (O-rings), charger holders, and some internal valve parts are commonly available for our dispensers. Keeping a spare gasket and tip on hand helps prevent downtime.|||
Dispensers are primarily for cold whipping. Many stainless steel models can handle warm liquids, but do not use boiling liquids and never heat a pressurised dispenser. If warming, keep below the temperature limit in the manual and maintain temperature with a warm-water bath, not open flames or stovetops. Aluminium models are generally for room-temperature or cooler contents unless stated otherwise.|||
Our dispensers are made from food-safe materials such as stainless steel or aluminium with BPA-free components and are produced under strict quality controls. Product specifications or conformity documents are available on request.|||
Gas leaks: reseat or replace the gasket and tighten the head. Liquid output: use very cold, high-fat cream, shake more, and dispense with the canister fully inverted; ensure the charger released gas. Clogged nozzle: fully depressurise, remove the tip, and clean the nozzle and valve. Stuck head: confirm all pressure is released, then gently loosen; never force under pressure. Weak pressure: use a new charger (two for 1 L) or recharge if the cream has sat for a while.

Palm leaf plates are crafted from fallen Areca palm leaves that are cleaned and heat pressed into shape. No chemicals or binders are used. Each plate is a single leaf with natural grain and colour variation.|||
Yes. They are more rigid than paper, comfortably hold heavy meals, and resist leaks with wet or oily foods. They are also cut resistant for normal dining.|||
Yes. They handle hot foods, are microwave safe for about 2 minutes, and oven safe for around 30-45 minutes up to 180 degrees C. Not suitable for open flame or very high heat.|||
They are largely neutral. A mild natural leaf scent may be noticeable on opening, but they do not impart flavour to food.|||
Yes. Leaves are washed then heat pressed, which sanitises and sterilises the surface. There are no additives or coatings; store in a clean, dry place.|||
They are designed for single use and composting. Light reuse is possible only if clean and dry, but washing is not recommended.|||
In home compost they typically break down in about 6-8 weeks, often faster in commercial composting. Actual time varies with heat and moisture.|||
Yes. With quality linens and cutlery they present as natural, elegant tableware. The unique grain complements formal settings.

Birch cutlery is made from natural birch wood with no plastic coating. It is biodegradable, compostable, and sourced from renewable timber. It breaks down like other wood and is a sustainable alternative to single-use plastic.|||
Yes. Birch cutlery is safe for hot and cold foods. Quality pieces are smooth and splinter free. Under normal use they will not break or shed fibres; just avoid bending or snapping them deliberately.|||
Yes. You can place used birch cutlery in home compost, where it will break down over time, or in kerbside organics where available. If composting is not an option, it can go in general rubbish and will still degrade much faster than plastic. Composting is the best option.|||
No. Our birch utensils are not painted or varnished and have no chemical coatings. They are simply cut, sanded, and polished wood for safe contact with food and easy composting.|||
Birch cutlery is sturdy for single-use dining. Forks and spoons handle most meals. Knives have light serration suitable for softer items. For very tough foods, performance will not match metal cutlery.|||
Birch wood is generally neutral in taste. Most people notice no flavour change. A slight woody note may be detectable with very hot foods, but it is minimal.|||
Birch is natural wood that composts in home or industrial settings and clearly signals a sustainable choice. PLA is plant based but typically needs industrial composting and can soften with heat. If easy composting and wider disposal options are priorities, birch is usually the better option.|||
Yes. Birch handles wet and oily foods during a normal meal. Utensils may darken slightly where damp but remain solid and usable. If left soaking for hours they will soften, so dispose or compost after use.|||
Store in a cool, dry place in the box or a sealed container. Keep away from moisture, direct sun, and strong odours. There is no fixed expiry; for best appearance use within one to two years.|||
Yes. Birch cutlery arrives clean, is intended for single use, and meets food contact requirements. Use once and discard or compost. Keep unused cutlery dry and clean before service.
